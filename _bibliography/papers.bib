    abstract = {This study provides the first empirical evidence that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) systematically retrieves micro-level accounting reports to aid its understanding of the state of the macroeconomy. Using unique data identifying its direct access of corporate SEC filings, we show that the Fed tracks firms that are bellwethers and industry leaders, or that can engender systemic risk. The qualitative information in the Fed-accessed periodic reports explains the Fed's GDP growth forecasts for up to four quarters, after controlling for contemporaneous aggregate earnings and other economic information. However, professional forecasts fail to incorporate such qualitative accounting information. In addition, this qualitative information is reflected in the tone of the ensuing FOMC meeting discussions as well as in Fed forecasts of key macro demand and supply factors. Overall, our evidence suggests important externalities of micro-level accounting reports, especially qualitative disclosures, on the central bank's macroeconomic forecasts and, by extension, monetary policy.Data Availability: Data are available from public sources.},

	title={Macroeconomic Information Acquisition around Earnings Clusters},
	author={Ferracuti, Elia and Lind, Gary},
	type={Working Paper},
	journal={Revise and Resubmit at JAR},
	year={},
	abstract={Recent literature documents that the time structure of information arrival through earnings announcements has important implications for asset prices. We show that one possible reason for this relation is the interaction between the time structure of information release by firms and macro information acquisition by investors. We document that investors acquire relatively more macro information during earnings clusters---days when many firms announce earnings contemporaneously---relative to non-cluster days. We further show that on these days, investors trade to adjust their exposure to the macroeconomy, and aggregate uncertainty declines. Finally, evidence indicates that our findings arise from two mechanisms: earnings clusters serving as conduits of macro information that trigger investors' attention toward the macroeconomy, and earnings clusters straining investors' attention capacity, thus inducing a reallocation of attention from firm-specific to aggregate information.},

	title={Central Bank Economic Transparency and Managerial Learning},
	author={Binz, Oliver and  Ferracuti, Elia and Lind, Gary},
	type={Working Paper},
	journal={Under review at RFS},

	html={https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4639866},
	abstract={Central banks have increased public disclosures of their private information regarding the economy's current and future state over time. While previous research focuses on the benefits of this increase in transparency, we provide an analytical framework and empirical evidence for potential unintended costs. We find that central bank economic transparency (CBET) causes managers to rely less on stock price when making investment decisions. This is consistent with central bank disclosures shifting investors' information collection and pricing from the aggregate-level component of cash flows (where managers do not have an information advantage) to the firm-level component (where managers do have an information advantage). The results are pronounced when the firm does not provide guidance and when noise trading in the firm's stock is low. Further, we show that investors shift their search efforts from aggregate-level towards firm-level information, and that investment efficiency of more exposed firms' falls relative to that of less exposed firms. The results are robust to using the Bank of England's Inflation Report amendments as a shock to CBET.},

	title={Democratizing Financial Forecasting: Predicting Retail Sales Revenue from Internet Search Behavior},
	author={Lind, Gary and Ramesh, K.},
	type={Working Paper},
	journal={Under review at CAR},
	year={},
	abstract={Business-to-consumer firms have leveraged the internet's ubiquitous information access by designing digital platforms that showcase their products, prices, and personalized promotions. This provides a compelling setting to examine whether the readily accessible data on consumer internet search for retail firms and products can be a leading indicator of retail sales revenue. Predicting retail sales is important given (1) the preponderance of revenue forecasts by equity analysts next only to EPS forecasts and (2) retail spending is part of personal consumption expenditures which represent a large majority of the US GDP. Using a large sample of retail firms, we show that a parsimonious, low-cost measure of internet search intensity nowcasts quarterly sales revenue both in and out of sample after conditioning on the time series properties of sales revenue. We also find that current search behavior reflects consumer research for future purchases up to four quarters ahead. This result holds even after we control for revenue deferral due to accrual accounting, highlighting the measure's ability to capture unrealized future demand. Additional analysis shows that our results hold for all retail segments except for commodities and impulse goods where internet search is unlikely to be a precursor to consumer purchase. Furthermore, we find that sales-relevant information in current search is not fully incorporated in analyst forecasts. Moreover, the search intensity is valuable in nowcasting neglected firms' revenue. Finally, aggregating our quarterly measure at the industry level provides further evidence of its construct validity, as a statistical decomposition of our search measure and the Census Bureau's advance retail sales show a very strong correspondence between their permanent, seasonal, and transitory components. A takeaway is that, with different investors facing disparate cost-benefit trade-offs, the demand for different digital era data channels will continue to evolve and can further transform the market for information goods.},

	title={Connecting statistical and disclosure-driven models of earnings disaggregation},
	author={Lind, Gary and Naranjo, Patricia and Ramesh, K.},
	type={Working Paper},
	journal={Under review at TAR},
	year={},
	abstract={We show that the unobserved components model (UCM) with look-ahead wisdom effectively models EPS's permanent, cyclical, and transitory components. Using this decomposition, we find that the intertemporal volatility of EPS is influenced by the least studied---the cyclical component---which contributes substantially to explaining stock return variation. However, what GAAP disaggregation rules view as non-recurring is commingled with the cyclical component, which has different valuation effects than one-time charges. Questioning the traditional perspective of viewing them as purely transitory, we find that negative special items are leading indicators of the cyclical component of earnings. Managers attempt to overcome the limits of GAAP disaggregation rules by reflecting cyclical profits in qualitative disclosures. Finally, we show that UCM components estimated without look-ahead wisdom explain stock return variations over and above shocks to core and non-core earnings per equity analysts, suggesting a broader role for this methodology in financial analysis and valuation},

	title={The Macro Informativeness of Micro Transactions},
	author={Lind, Gary},
	type={Working Paper},
	journal={Under review at Management Science},
	year={},
	abstract={I show that, consistent with theory, the volume of business transactions increases during good economic states relative to bad (Veldkamp 2005). As more transactions are aggregated in financial reports, the precision of the macroeconomic signal in aggregated accounting information increases, so that accounting reports contain more precise macroeconomic information during good states of the economy when transaction volume is high than bad states when the volume is low (Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp 2006). Lastly, the macroeconomic information dynamics of aggregate earnings follow economic theory: macro content grows throughout good states as agents become more confident and the information environment improves.},
