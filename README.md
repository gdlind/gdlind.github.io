# Gary Lind

I am an assistant professor at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://business.pitt.edu/)). I teach Managerial Accounting.

I research the intersection between accounting and macroeconomics, with a special interest in the macroeconomic information content of accounting information, decisions under uncertainty, the externalities of accounting standards, the aggregation of accounting information, and the interplay between monetary policy and accounting information.

Before taking my current position at Pitt, I completed my doctoral studies in accounting, and masters studies in management and economics all at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, Texas.
